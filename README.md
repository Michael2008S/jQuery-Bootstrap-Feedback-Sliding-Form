jQuery-Bootstrap-Feedback-Sliding-Form
======================================

Left hand tab on your page that when clicked produces a slide-out contact / feedback form using Twitter Bootstrap

Twitter bootstrap, fly out contact or feedback form with validation and Ajax submission
Ok, I have taken a look at several of the contact or feedback forms on the internet in
the past few weeks and they all work great, however, they require varying numbers
of includes, and in some cases images, or even completely different versions of JQuery 
to get them up and running. The solutions that take advantage of HTML and the latest
version of bootstrap.js are practically non-existent.  So I thought why not roll my own 
then pass it on, after all it comes in at six lines of JavaScript code for
the toggle (I added a form validation and ajax submit for those that need help there) ,
some CSS, and a good old fashioned HTML form tag. At the very least will introduce you
to a few JavaScript features that you may not have been used to seeing.
